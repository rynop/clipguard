* Prevent video interview tampering
* Modify videos in post-production to push an agenda or change the narritve of the inverviewee

* Let me show you

  - Share QR code

  - Only with myself initially (keep it safe)
  - After interview has aired, share the QR code with whoever you like.
  - I've put a link to the QR code in description below. Scan it with the ClipGuard app and you can use it to validate that the content of this video was not altered in post-production :)

* Who does this help?

  - Honestly, probably only a handful of peopel in the world. CEOs, politicians, celebrities, witness interviews.
  - This is the 1st app I've created, wanted to solve a simple problem - but also wanted something that forced me to use leverage a decent ammount of native app functionality.
  - I'm also a big nerd, with lots of crazy ideas, so I think its a cool idea no one else has solved.

- Not fool proof. While revrese engineering and re-producing will take some work and alot of time, it is not impossible. However, I think it adiquately solves the problem

- projects page on rynop.com / search your app store for ClipGuard

- Sorry for the studdering - I had to do this in one take :)
